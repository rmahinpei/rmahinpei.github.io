# Personal Website

## Purpose
To expand my programming skills during the summer of 2021, I decided to use HTML, CSS, and JS to build my first personal website. You can visit the completed project [here](https://rmahinpei.github.io/).

## Learning Resources
Here are some of the learning resources I used to get my website started:
