I am a fully-funded Master of Science & Engineering (MSE) student at [Princeton University's Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/). 

I received a Bachelor's of Science (BSc) degree in Honours Computer Science along with a Mathematics Minor at the University of British Columbia (UBC). During my undergrad, I had the pleasure of working with the [Systopia lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/) and the Numerical Linear Algebra lab at [UBC's Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/).

My research experience spans human-computer interaction, applied machine learning & artificial intelligence, and computer systems (focusing on high-performance computing). My current research interests are in **human-centred AI**, **social computing**, and **educational technologies**.

## Projects
**Leveraging Collaborative Filtering for Personalized Practice in Computer-Based Assessments**\
![HCI Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HCI-pink) ![ML Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/ML%2FAI-purple)\
[Code Repo](https://github.com/rmahinpei/personalized-practice) | [PDF](https://github.com/rmahinpei/personalized-practice/blob/main/docs/report.pdf)
- Explored collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommender systems for personalizing question selection in computer-based assessments by predicting student performance on new, unseen questions using past scores.
- Developed and evaluated six CF models against baseline model using Dietterich's 5×2 cross-validation method on two datasets from an undergraduate computer systems course and assessed model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), with statistical significance determined through a paired t-test.

**Mixed Precision Minimal Residual (MINRES) Method**\
[Code Repo](https://github.com/rmahinpei/mixed-precision-minres) | [PDF](https://github.com/rmahinpei/mixed-precision-minres/blob/main/thesis_mahinpei.pdf)
- Proposed two mixed precision variants of the Minimal Residual (MINRES) that vary the precision of the preconditioner solves and the matrix-vector products.
- Implemented the proposed mixed precision variants using CUDA C and made performance measurements on NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3070 Ti graphics card for Maxwell and Stokes saddle-point problems.

**A Generalized Framework for Describing Question Randomization**\
[Code Repo](https://github.com/open-resources/randomization_framework/tree/main) | [PDF](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626253.3635599)
- Introduced a randomization framework with six distinct levels to address the limitations in describing the diversity of question randomization in computer-based assessments.
- Complemented the framework with practical guides, including a decision tree and a usage table, to assist educators in effectively using the randomization framework.

**Low Precision Training of Deep Learning Models**\
[Code Repo](https://github.com/rmahinpei/low-precision-deep-learning) | [PDF](https://github.com/rmahinpei/low-precision-deep-learning/blob/main/docs/report.pdf)
- Investigated the impact of four general low precision schemes on the training time and classification accuracy of four different deep learning models from the domains of image and text classification.
- Implemented multi-precision and mixed-precision schemes of the selected models using TensorFlow and made performance measurements on Google Colab’s Tesla T4 GPU to examine the trade-offs between speed and accuracy.
