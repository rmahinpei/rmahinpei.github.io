I am a fully-funded Master of Science & Engineering (MSE) student at [Princeton University's Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/). 

I received a Bachelor's of Science (BSc) degree in Honours Computer Science along with a Mathematics Minor at the University of British Columbia (UBC). During my undergraduate degree, I had the pleasure of working with the [Human-AI Interaction Lab](https://hai.cs.ubc.ca/), the [Scientific Computing lab](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/scl/index.html_), and the [Systopia lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/) at [UBC's Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/). As part of my MSE degree, I am currently working with the [Humans and Machines lab](https://humans-and-machines.github.io/) directed by [Dr. Manoel Horta Ribeiro](https://manoelhortaribeiro.github.io/).

My experiences span human-computer interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence (AI), applied machine learning, and systems research. My current research interests are in **AI in education**, **human-centred AI**, **social computing**, and **computational social science**.

## Projects
**Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs) for Proof Education** [[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3758317.3759679) [[Code]](https://github.com/rmahinpei/itp_proof_education)\
![HCI Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HCI-pink) ![Systems Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Systems-blue)
- Conducted a user study and case study analyzing how students develop proofs using the [Coq ITP](https://rocq-prover.org/), the [Lean ITP](https://lean-lang.org/), and traditional methods, focusing on usability and support for CS proof techniques.
- Evaluated Coq and Lean using Nielsen’s usability heuristics to identify challenges such as unclear error messages and limited support for example-driven learning.
- Synthesized findings to inform improvements to ITP design and provide practical guidance for instructors considering ITPs in CS education.

**An Emergent Bottom-Up Categorization of Students’ LLMs Usage in an Undergraduate Research Course** [[Paper]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-98462-4_17)\
![HCI Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HCI-pink) ![ML Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/ML%2FAI-purple)
- Conducted a thematic analysis of students’ self-reported usage patterns in third-year, multidisciplinary undergraduate research methods course targeting critical thinking skills.
- Developed a bottom-up categorization of how students use LLMs, grounded in actual student behaviour.

**Provenance Design and Evolution in a Production ML Library** [[Poster]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=VrbDf3UDgv&nesting=2&sort=date-desc) [[Code]](https://github.com/oracle/tribuo/tree/main) [[Tutorial]](https://tribuo.org/learn/4.3/tutorials/modelcard-tribuo-v4.html)\
![HCI Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HCI-pink) ![ML Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/ML%2FAI-purple) ![Systems Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Systems-blue)
- Studied the current state of data workflows across users from academia (N = 6) and industry (N = 6) and identified ways in which data provenance could simplify those workflows.
- Designed, implemented, and tested the Model Card package for [Tribuo](https://tribuo.org/), Oracle’s open-source Java ML library, to allow Tribuo users to create partially automated machine learning model documentation.

**A Generalized Framework for Describing Question Randomization** [[Paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3702652.3744222) [[Poster]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626253.3635599) [[Code]](https://github.com/open-resources/randomization_framework/tree/main) [[Video]](https://vimeo.com/1105304850) \
![HCI Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HCI-pink)
- Conducted a thematic analysis of computer-based assessment questions in two undergraduate CS courses to investigate how instructors integrate randomization into their digital assessment questions.
- Developed a six-level framework to systematically categorize these randomization strategies and validated the framework by applying it to questions from an undergraduate data structures course (N = 86) and an undergraduate computer systems course (N = 100), assessing inter-rater reliability using percentage agreement and Gwet’s AC1 coefficient.

**Mixed Precision Minimal Residual (MINRES) Method** [[Paper]](https://siam-web.useast01.umbraco.io/media/g4ypl0f2/s167848r.pdf) [[Code]](https://github.com/rmahinpei/mixed-precision-minres)\
![Systems Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Systems-blue) 
- Developed two mixed precision variants of the Minimal Residual (MINRES) method for solving sparse saddle-point linear systems, allowing users to adjust the precision of preconditioner solves and matrix-vector products.
- Implemented these variants and a baseline version using CUDA C and conducted a comparative performance study on NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, evaluating speed-up across three Maxwell and three Stokes saddle-point systems.
