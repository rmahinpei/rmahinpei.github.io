I am a fully-funded Master of Science & Engineering (M.S.E.) student in the Computer Science department at Princeton University. 
I received a Bachelor's of Science (B.S.) degree in Honours Computer Science along with a Mathematics Minor at The University of British Columbia. 
My current research interests include **high performance computing, human-centred artificial intelligence, and computer science education**.

## Projects
**Low Precision Training of Deep Learning Models**

[Code Repo](https://github.com/rmahinpei/low-precision-deep-learning) | [PDF](https://github.com/rmahinpei/low-precision-deep-learning/blob/main/docs/report.pdf)
- Investigated the impact of four general low precision schemes on the training time and classification accuracy of four different deep learning models from the domains of image and text classification.
- Implemented multi-precision and mixed-precision schemes of the selected models and examined the performance trade-offs between speed and accuracy after making measurements on Google Colab’s Tesla T4 GPU.


**Personalized Practice Quizzes**


**A Generalized Framework for Describing Question Randomization**

[Code Repo](https://github.com/open-resources/randomization_framework/tree/main) | [PDF](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626253.3635599)
- Introduced a randomization framework with six distinct levels to address the limitations in describing the diversity of question randomization in computer-based assessments.
- Complemented the framework with practical guides, including a decision tree and a usage table, to assist educators in effectively using the randomization framework.
