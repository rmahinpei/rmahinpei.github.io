I am a fully-funded Master of Science & Engineering (M.S.E.) student at [Princeton University's Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/). 

I received a Bachelor's of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Honours Computer Science along with a Mathematics Minor at the University of British Columbia (UBC). During my undergrad, I had the pleasure of working with the [Systopia lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/) and the Numerical Linear Algebra lab at [UBC's Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/).

My current research interests include **human-centered AI, human-computer interaction, social computing, and educational technologies**.

## Research
**Mixed Precision Minimal Residual (MINRES) Method**\
[Code Repo](https://github.com/rmahinpei/mixed-precision-minres) | [PDF](https://github.com/rmahinpei/mixed-precision-minres/blob/main/thesis_mahinpei.pdf)
- Proposed two mixed precision variants of the Minimal Residual (MINRES) that vary the precision of the preconditioner solves and the matrix-vector products.
- Implemented the proposed mixed precision variants using CUDA C and made performance measurements on NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3070 Ti graphics card for Maxwell and Stokes saddle-point problems.

**A Generalized Framework for Describing Question Randomization**\
[Code Repo](https://github.com/open-resources/randomization_framework/tree/main) | [PDF](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626253.3635599)
- Introduced a randomization framework with six distinct levels to address the limitations in describing the diversity of question randomization in computer-based assessments.
- Complemented the framework with practical guides, including a decision tree and a usage table, to assist educators in effectively using the randomization framework.

**Low Precision Training of Deep Learning Models**\
[Code Repo](https://github.com/rmahinpei/low-precision-deep-learning) | [PDF](https://github.com/rmahinpei/low-precision-deep-learning/blob/main/docs/report.pdf)
- Investigated the impact of four general low precision schemes on the training time and classification accuracy of four different deep learning models from the domains of image and text classification.
- Implemented multi-precision and mixed-precision schemes of the selected models using TensorFlow and made performance measurements on Google Colab’s Tesla T4 GPU to examine the trade-offs between speed and accuracy.

**Leveraging Collaborative Filtering for Personalized Practice in Computer-Based Assessments**\
[Code Repo](https://github.com/rmahinpei/personalized-practice-quizzes) | [PDF](https://github.com/rmahinpei/personalized-practice-quizzes/blob/main/docs/report.pdf)
- Implemented six different collaborative filtering (CF) models using the [Surprise SciPy Toolkit](https://surpriselib.com/) and trained the models to predict student performance scores on new questions based on past performance scores.
- Conducted paired t-tests against an average-based baseline model to evaluate the suitability of these CF models in predicting performance scores on new questions, with these scores then being used to create a personalized set of practice questions.
