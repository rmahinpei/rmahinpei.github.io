                Although I <b>strongly</b> believe in the benefits of personal note taking, I also think that it can be useful to take a look at someone else's notes in order to see if there is a different perspective from which you can understand the content. 
                To support this belief, I've included some of my condensed notes for the major UBC CS courses, but I again emphasize that this should <b>not</b> replace personal note taking by any means!
