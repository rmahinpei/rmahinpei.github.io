                Most of my recent learnings and interests have focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods">formal methods</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant">interactive theorem provers</a>, especially the practical applications of formal methods and the potential use of interactive theorem provers for educational purposes.

                At a high-level, formal methods apply mathematical thinking to computational systems. This usually involves rigorously <b>specifying</b> a system using a modelling language and then formally <b>verifying</b> the specified properties of that system. 
                There are two broad approaches to formal verification. The first is <b>model checking</b>, which requires that a finite model of a system is developed so that a <b>model checker</b> is can then explore the state space and determine whether a desired property is satisfied.
                The second is <b>theorem proving</b>, which requires that the system is specified with appropriate mathematical logic so that a <b>theorem prover</b> can then verify the properties of the system.
                More specifically, theorem provers are generally classified either as an <b>automated theorem prover (ATP)</b> or an <b>interactive theorem prover (ITP)</b>, with ITPs also being called proof assistants in literature. The main job of ATPs is to <i>find</i> the proof of a theorem while the main job of ITPs is to <i>verify</i> an already provided proof of a theorem via human-computer interactions.

                Although slightly outdated, <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/des_s99/formal_methods/">Michael Collins's article on formal methods</a> is a great introduction on what formal methods are all about and is a highly recommended read for anyone who's new to this topic. 
                Jeremy Avigad also has a <a href="https://avigad.github.io/formal_methods_in_education/">curated list of useful resources</a> for learning and/or teaching formal methods.
                Below, I've also included my recommended list of talks and papers relating to the applications of interactive theorem provers, especially for educational purposes.
                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1px">Recommended Talks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="https://youtu.be/3WBUHEVr56c">Introduction to the Coq Proof Assistant</a>: A 2010 talk by Andrew Appel that first briefly introduces the process to formally proving a theorem and the high-level overview on how theorem provers work before jumping into the specific features of Coq by going through tactics and examples. </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="https://youtu.be/IOiZatlZtGU">Propositions as Types</a>: A 2015 talk by Philip Wadler on the correspondence between mathematical logic and programming languages. The main takeaway was that propositions, proofs, and similification of proofs in logic accordingly correspond to types, programs, and evaluation of programs in programming languages. </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="https://youtu.be/0olimWS0SsM">Teaching Proofs to Computers</a>: A 2020 talk by Kevin Buzzard on the use of interactive theorem provers within mathematics. Buzzard is a huge advocate for using proof assistants, such as Lean, as a part of undergraduate mathematics curriculums in order to enable students to better understand proof structures and get automatic feedback on their work.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="https://youtu.be/56IIrBZy9Rc">Formal Methods for the Informal Engineer - The Z3 Theorem Prover</a>: A 2021 talk by Phil Zucker on the Z3 Theorem Prover. Although the talk mainly focuses on using Z3 via a Python API, there are also small sections discussing what formal methods are all about and how theorem provers work.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="https://youtu.be/5e7UdWzITyQ">Formal Methods for the Informal Engineer - The Coq Theorem Prover</a>: A 2021 talk by Cody Roux on the Coq Theorem Prover. The contents in this talk are much more technical compared to the talk above since the main focus is on learning the major features of Coq and then using Coq to prove some example propositions.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1px">Recommended Papers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3105726.3106184">Theorem Provers as a Learning Tool in Theory of Computation</a>: A 2017 educational design paper investigating whether and how the Coq Theorem Prover can be used as a learning tool within introductory theory of computation courses. The authors specifically designed a course on computational theory that relied on a mix of Coq proofs as well as traditional pen-and-paper proofs and collected qualitative, observational data during the process. Based on their findings, interactive theorem provers can indeed be leveraged for teaching purposes. They even concluded that their students were more motivated to work with Coq proofs in comparison to their traditional counterparts thanks to immediate feedback provided by Coq and the similarities to the programming-debugging cycle.
                    Some questions that I still have after reading the paper:
                    </li>
                    <ul style="padding-bottom: 0;">
                        <li style="margin-left:5px">Why was Coq chosen as the interactive theorem prover for this purpose? What was the main rationale?</li>
                        <li style="margin-left:5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Have there been any follow-up efforts in formalizing automata theory and creating pre-defined tactics?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03028">A Survey on Theorem Provers in Formal Methods</a>: A comprehensive survery from 2019 on the recent state of theorem provers. The authors first introduce formal methods and formal verification at a high-level, then highlight theorem proving as a branch of formal verification, and finally discuss and compare a wide variety of theorem provers based on different categorizations. 
                        The notable theorem provers covered by the authors include ACL2, Isabelle, Metamath, Agda, HOL, and Coq. Based on the findings within this paper, some relevant areas of further exploration include:</li>
                    <ul style="padding-bottom: 0;">
                        <li style="margin-left:5px">Increasing IDE support and graphical/visualization tools for theorem provers.</li>
                        <li style="margin-left:5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Increasing interoperability between different theorem prover systems (e.g., enabling theorems to be imported from one prover to another).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-71374-4_12">Teaching formal methods in academia - A systematic literature review</a>: A concise literature review from 2021 discussing the major challenges in teaching formal methods along with potential solutions. The author emphasizes how the isolation of formal methods most within CS curriculums and the steep learning curves accompanying most formal verification tools results in students' skepticism towards this topic. To mitigate this issue, the author suggests that formal methods are integrated into introductory CS courses and that educators develop specialized IDE plug-ins or web-based interfaces in order to make formal verification tools easier for students to use.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0020739X.2023.2178981">Interactive theorem provers for university mathematics - an exploratory study of students' perceptions</a>: A 2022 paper discussing the integration of the Lean Theorem Prover into a first-year mathematics course taught during the 2018-2019 academic year. Although the use of the interactive theorem prover was not compulsory, students were exposed to Lean as a part of lectures and also had optional weekly tutorials to learn more about its features and use. Based on the results from questionnaires and semi-structured interviews collected near the end of the term, the authors concluded that the use of Lean within the course had both advantages as well as its disadvantages. Some students enjoyed the use of Lean while others felt discouraged by the learning curve accompanying the use of Lean.</li>
                    <ul style="padding-bottom: 0;">
                        <li style="margin-left:5px">My personal takeaway from this paper was that there is no single perfect way of teaching proofs to students. In an ideal world, we should have multiple approaches for proof writing available to students (so both the formalized and traditional ways) since preferences will likely vary.</li>
                        <li style="margin-left:5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">It's also interesting to note that the mixed response to the use of interactive theorem provers in education came from math students. Would the response be the same for CS students? Would they be more excited about the integration of interactive theorem provers into their curriculum?</li>
