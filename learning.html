                Most of my recent learnings and interests have focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods">formal methods</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant">interactive theorem provers</a>, especially the practical applications of formal methods and the potential use of interactive theorem provers for educational purposes.

                <br>
                At a high-level, formal methods apply mathematical thinking to computational systems. This usually involves rigorously <b>specifying</b> a system using a modelling language and then formally <b>verifying</b> the specified properties of that system. 
                A common application of formal methods is to verify that hardware and software systems are error-free.
                Although slightly outdated, <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/des_s99/formal_methods/">Michael Collins's article on formal methods</a> is a great introduction on what formal methods are all about and is a highly recommended read for anyone who's new to this topic.

                Below is a recommended list of talks and papers relating to the applications of interactive theorem provers, especially for educational purposes.
                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1px">Recommended Talks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="https://youtu.be/IOiZatlZtGU">Propositions as Types</a>: A 2015 talk by Philip Wadler on the correspondence between mathematical logic and programming languages. The main takeaway was that propositions, proofs, and similification of proofs in logic accordingly correspond to types, programs, and evaluation of programs in programming languages. </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="https://youtu.be/0olimWS0SsM">Teaching Proofs to Computers</a>: A 2020 talk by Kevin Buzzard on the use of interactive theorem provers within mathematics. Buzzard is a huge advocate for using proof assistants, such as Lean, as a part of undergraduate mathematics curriculums in order to enable students to better understand proof structures and get automatic feedback on their work.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="https://youtu.be/56IIrBZy9Rc">Formal Methods for the Informal Engineer - The Z3 Theorem Prover</a>: A 2021 talk by Phil Zucker on the Z3 Theorem Prover. Although the talk mainly focuses on using Z3 via a Python API, there are also small sections discussing what formal methods are all about and how theorem provers work.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="https://youtu.be/5e7UdWzITyQ">Formal Methods for the Informal Engineer - The Coq Theorem Prover</a>: A 2021 talk by Cody Roux on the Coq Theorem Prover. The contents in this talk are much more technical compared to the talk above since the main focus is on learning the major features of Coq and then using Coq to prove some example propositions.</li>
