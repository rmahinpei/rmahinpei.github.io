            Here are some of the projects that I've taken on over the years, many of which are simply my attempts at applying newly gained skills. 
            Feel free to learn more about any of them by visiting <a href="https://github.com/rmahinpei">my GitHub</a>.

            <b>Website Application - Romina Mahinpei's Personal Website</b>
            <div class="description">
                <b><u>May 2021</u></b> - Yep, this website is one of my most recent projects. I decided to use <b>Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</b> to develop my web application, which allowed me to use <b>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</b> to specify the web structure, <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> to specify the web design, and <b>JavaScript (JS)</b> to specify the website's interactive elements. 
                <br>
                I used this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/develop-web-apps-with-vs-code/">Microsoft module</a> as my main learning resource, but there are also many YouTube videos that can get you started! 
                The main goal of this website is to show anyone who may be new to the world of coding that they can easily get started on a coding project with little to no prior experience thanks to all the resources that are available online! 
                I hope that my projects encourage you to start some of your own and that the learning resources I share help you with getting started!

            <b>Python Model - Tracking Blood Alcohol Concentration</b>
            <div class="description">
                <b><u>April 2021</u></b> - As part of a final project for my first-year in university, I had to work with a partner and come up with a unique project proposal. 
                Considering my interest in CS and my partner’s interest in biology, we decided to combine the two domains for our project and look at how different alcohol consumption behaviours affect the trend in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over time. 
                <br>
                My amazing partner (Stephanie Lapadat) proposed a simplified compartmental pathway for alcohol within the human body, which I then implemented with <b>Python</b> in <b>Jupyter Notebook</b> in order for us to collect data. 
                I used this <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/">free textbook</a> to expand my Python knowledge for this project.
                <br>

            <b>Python Model - Tracking Weight after Calorie Reduction</b>
            <div class="description">
                <b><u>March 2021</u></b> - As a part of UBC’s Research Experience (REX) program, I had the privilege to work under the supervision of Dr. Leah-Edelstein Keshet (UBC Math Department) and start a project with personal significance. 
                To combine my love for math and CS, I decided to take a mathematical model of weight loss proposed by Diana M. Thomas in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2764961/">her 2009 publication</a>, implement the model with <b>Python</b> in <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>, and then track a subject’s weight over time following a 25% calorie reduction. Most of my Python knowledge came from the same textbook mentioned above.

            <b>Math Publication - Minimizing the Use of Polyethene inside Paper Coffee Cups</b>
            <div class="description">
                <b><u>March 2021</u></b> - It always saddens me to see how the vast applications of mathematics go <i>unappreciated</i>. To make the public more aware of some of the great applications, I started a mathematical investigation on the use of polyethene inside paper coffee cups and had my paper published by the STEM Fellowship Journal (SFJ).
                <br> My paper proposes a mathematical strategy that uses differential and integral calculus to determine the cup dimensions that minimize the amount of polyethene needed to coat the internal surface area of a coffee cup while still keeping the cup’s volume and lid size the same.
                <br> Feel free to check out the paper <a href="https://journal.stemfellowship.org/doi/10.17975/sfj-2020-011">here</a>.

            <b>Math Publication - A Comparative Analysis of the Gini Index</b>
            <div class="description">
                <b><u>February 2021</u></b> - This paper, again published by SFJ, was another one of my attempts at highlighting the beauty of math. The focus of this paper was on the Gini Index, which summarizes the income disparity of an area into a single value that falls between zero and one.
                There are numerous methods for evaluating the Gini index, and my paper compares the Gini indices obtained using three of the earliest developed methods to see whether there would be any discrepancies between the obtained results.

            <b>Java Programs - TripPlanner, Battleships</b>
            <div class="description">
                <b><u>July 2020</u></b>
                To continue my CS learning, I decided to take <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/learn-to-program-in-java-2">Microsoft’s Learn to Program in Java</a> on edX. I found the course to be a great self-paced introduction that explained CS concepts using <b>Java</b> on <b>IntelliJ IDEA</b> very well and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is new to coding! I took on two projects to summarize and apply the skills I had gained during the course. 
                <br>
                The first project was TripPlanner, an interactive Java program that asks users for their current location, travel destination, and travel budget and calculates the user's daily budget (in both USD and the location's currency) and the total distance to the destination. The second project was Battleships, an interactive Java program that allows the user to play a game of Battleships against the computer.
                <br>
                Feel free to check out TripPlanner’s code <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmahinpei/Java-Projects/master/TripPlanner">here</a> or Battleship’s code <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmahinpei/Java-Projects/master/Battleships">here</a>.

            <b>Python Program - OnTrack</b>
            <div class="description">
                <b><u>May 2020</u></b> - My first introduction to the world of CS was through Stanford University’s Code in Place, an intro-to-coding program designed during the time of COVID-19 that is equivalent to Stanford’s CS106A. The two month long program explained introductory coding concepts using <b>Python</b> in <b>PyCharm</b>. 
                Although the program was offered during the start of the pandemic, you can check out <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/">Stanford's website</a> to see whether they plan to offer it again in the future.
                <br>
                In order to apply all the coding skills I had gained, I decided to build OnTrack. OnTrack is an interactive Python program that allows the user to keep track of their food consumption, physical activity, and water intake with the ultimate hope of encouraging users to be more mindful of their health. 
                <br>
                Feel free to check out my project code <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmahinpei/Python-Projects/master/OnTrack">here</a> or watch the demo video <a href="https://youtu.be/ySRz24RFVrE">here</a>.
