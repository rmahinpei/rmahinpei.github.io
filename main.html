            Thanks for taking the time to check my <i>very simple</i> website! I got introduced to the amazing world of coding and computer science about a year ago - so I still consider myself as a beginner and have lots of learnig to do!
            <br>
            <br>
            My hope is to share my progress and learning resources as I go through this journey here on this website. Feel free to join me by checking out my <a href="first.html">Projects</a> where I discuss all the resources that I used for my learning. The more learners the better!

            There are honestly so many reasons to why you should learn to code, but in case you're not yet convinced, here are just a few:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Coding is becoming a necessary skill in jobs and fields unrelated to the tech world (e.g.: life sciences).</li>
            <li>Coding skills can help your application stand out.</li>
            <li>Coding helps improve problem solving and logic skills.</li>
            <li>And of course - because <u>anyone</u> can do it!!!</li>
        </ol>
        If you're still <strike>not convinced</strike> looking for more reasons, feel free to check out the original <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/courses/computer-science-information-systems/why-everyone-should-learn-code#:~:text=Coding%20can%20boost%20problem%20solving,left%E2%80%9D%20side%20of%20the%20brain.">article</a> on why everyone should learn coding!
        <br>
        Good luck and <b>HAPPY CODING</b>!!!
